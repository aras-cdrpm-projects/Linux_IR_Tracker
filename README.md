# Linux IR Tracker
Controlling robotic manipulators often involves measuring or estimating its position in the space. In this project, two inexpensive PS3 cameras are taken and an optical tracker system is build upon them. First, the standard lenses installed on the cameras were replaced by two off-the-shelf night vision CCTV lenses. This is done because the standard lenses blocked any IR light. In the next step, the synchronizer signals of the cameras were exposed and through them, frame synchronization was carried out. Moreover, an old floppy disk was used as a visible-light filter to block all the visible light from passing through. Therefore, what the camera sees is a shining dot in a block background. In the software, photogrammetry algorithms are implemented to convert pixel coordinate of this shining light to the metric numbers representing the LED's position. Being capable of capturing images at a rate of 120Hz, the PS3 camera produces a position feedback suitable for numerous controlling applications. This document will be completed in the future and further instructions and tutorials will be added.
