# Linux IR Tracker
Controlling robotic manipulators often involves measuring or estimating its position in the space. In this project two inexpensive PS3 cameras are taken and an optical tracker system is build upon them. First, the standard lenses were removed and two of the shelve CCTV lenses were adapted to the cameras. Then, the synchronizer signals of the cameras were exposed and through them frame sysncronization was carried out. Moreover, an old floppy disk as an visible-light filter was used to block all the visible light from achieving to the camera. Therefore, the system can only observe the IR light emitted from an LED installed on the end-effector. In the software, photogrammetry algorithms are employed for converting the pixel measurements to metric positions of the LED. Being capable of capturing images at a rate of 120Hz, the PS3 camera produces a position feedback suitable for many controlling applications. This document will be completed in the future and further instructions and tutorials will be added.
